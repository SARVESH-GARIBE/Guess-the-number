# Guess-the-number

The "Guess the Number" game is a simple JavaScript game where the player has to guess a predefined number. The game prompts the user to enter guesses until they correctly guess the number. It’s a fun way to practice JavaScript and understand user input handling through prompt and while loops.

Message on Success: Once the correct number is guessed, a message appears in the browser console confirming the correct guess.
How to Play

A prompt will appear asking you to guess a number.

Code Explanation
The number to be guessed is hard-coded in the gameNum variable.
The game uses the prompt function to get user input and compares the guess with the correct number.
A while loop is used to repeatedly ask the user for a new guess until the correct number is entered.
When the correct number is guessed, a success message is logged in the console.
